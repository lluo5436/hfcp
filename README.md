Author: Ling Luo, Bin Li, Xuhui Fan, YangWang, Irena Koprinska, Fang Chen

(1) HFCPMain.m: this file creates a synthetic dataset and calls hfcp function to build HFCP model on this dataset.

(2) hfcp.m: this file contains the function to complete the inference of hfcp. More details can be found in Section 5 of the manuscript.

(3) drchrnd.m: this file is a function to sample from a Dirichlet distribution.
